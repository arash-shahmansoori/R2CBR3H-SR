For example, the Legal, Ethics, and Governance working group addresses questions related to data licensing, attribution of generated code, redaction of personally identifiable information (PII), and the risks of outputting malicious code.\n\nInspired by Hugging Face's open-source text-generating systems, BigCode aims to address controversies surrounding AI-powered code generation. Critics, such as the nonprofit Software Freedom Conservancy, have raised concerns about the use of public source code, which may not have a permissive license, to train and monetize Codex. Codex is accessible through OpenAI's and Microsoft's paid APIs, while GitHub has recently started its own initiative in this area."}]
